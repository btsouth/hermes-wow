"""The release artifact: what a zip is allowed to contain, and what it must refuse.

The two mistakes this catches are the ones that survive a green test suite because
they are about the *bundle*, not the code: a zip rooted one folder too deep (the
client and every installer reject it), and `addon/__audit_copy__/` riding along -
a second copy of the addon with its own `HermesAI.toc`, which is exactly the sort
of thing that ships once and confuses people for years.

The strongest assertion here is the last one: the *shipped* artifact is unpacked
and put through the release lint, so the zip is proven to be the thing that passed.

Run: python3 tests/package_test.py
