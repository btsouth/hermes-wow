"""The panel previewer: the file that produces the store-page pictures.

It had no gate, and the cost of that showed up twice in one sitting - a refactor
moved the CSS out of its `<style>` tag so the browser drew the stylesheet as body
text, and the row's second line was still painted in one colour a week after the
addon split it into a coloured word and a muted trail. Both are visible only by
looking at a render, and both are checkable without one.

Run: python3 tests/preview_test.py
