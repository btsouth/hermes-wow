"""Move the interface pin, in both places it is written down.

The toc's `## Interface` is what the client compares against its own build, and
`tests/addon_checks.py` holds the expected value deliberately: a lint that read the
toc would be checking the toc against itself, which is the kind of gate this
project has already removed once. So two copies is the right shape - and also
exactly how they drift, which is why they move together here rather than by hand.

Read the number in game, then run it:

    /run print(GetBuildInfo())     # -> 1.60.1 69913 Sep 17 2026 16001
    make interface IFACE=16001

The third place the number appears is prose: `docs/design/wow-mode.md` records the
build it was confirmed against, which is a fact rather than a setting, so this
prints the line to update instead of rewriting it.
