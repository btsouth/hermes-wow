-- The bridge writes data, never code, and this is the whole reason the format is
-- a delimited string instead of a Lua table: a truncated file or a hostile one
-- yields "no data" here, not an error frame and not injected Lua.
--
-- Fallback order matters for honesty. A payload that is missing, malformed or
-- from an incompatible bridge version must NOT render as an empty board (that
-- reads as "your agents are idle"), so the last good snapshot is kept in
-- SavedVariables and labelled as stale instead.
