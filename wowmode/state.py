"""Where this tool keeps its state, and how it writes it.

Four modules used to rebuild the XDG paths and hand-roll their own
write-to-temp-and-rename, which is four chances to get it subtly wrong. The
details that matter and are easy to miss:

* a UNIQUE temp name: a fixed one means two processes (the watcher and a manual
  publish) truncate each other's half-written file
* `fsync` before the rename: without it a power cut can leave a zero-length file
  where the state used to be, which the reader then has to treat as damage
* 0600 on the state files: they hold the player's own reply text and session ids
* a directory `fsync` after the rename, so the rename itself survives
