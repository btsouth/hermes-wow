"""Roster engine for hermes-wow: every Hermes session as one triage row.

Read-only against the canonical session store (``$HERMES_HOME/state.db``). Two
independent signals, because neither alone is enough:

* the DB is cross-process truth — titles, projects, unread, end state, and the
  rate-limited ``last_activity_description`` the agent writes while it works;
* ``session_turn_leases`` is the one row a *running* turn must hold, so a live
  turn is visible from outside the process that owns it (that is what makes
  "Working" honest in a second window).

Status priority, highest first: needs > error > working > reply > idle/finished.
