"""Remote hosts: other machines running Hermes, merged into one board.

The board is not very useful if the agents you care about live on three boxes.
Two rules make that a feature instead of a liability:

* **No remote install.** The roster module is self-contained stdlib Python, so the
  bridge ships it over SSH on every poll (`ssh host python3 - < roster.py`). The
  remote side needs Hermes and python3, nothing else, and there is no second copy
  of the bucketing logic to drift from the local one.
* **A dead host must not look like finished work.** Each host has a timeout and a
  cache; when a fetch fails its last known rows are kept and marked offline with
  their age, and the local publish never waits on it.
