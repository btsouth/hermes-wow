"""Out-of-game notification: the live half of freshness.

In game the client only re-reads addon files when the UI loads, so nothing the
bridge does can appear in game until the player syncs. What the bridge *can* do
is notice a transition the moment it happens and tell the player through a
channel that is not the game: a desktop notification, or a message on whatever
platform their Hermes gateway is paired to.

Only transitions notify, never states. A fresh install seeds its state silently
so it cannot fire a wall of alerts about sessions that went stale last week, and
each (session, kind) pair has a cooldown so a flapping session cannot spam.
